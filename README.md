# Proxy Targeting and Multiplex Resilience for Organized Crime Network Disruption in Corporate Interlock and Communications Networks

Example code for the native targeting and proxy targeting protocols for network cohesion and disruption analyses in Breuer, N. (2025). Proxy Targeting and Multiplex Resilience for Organized Crime Network Disruption in Corporate Interlock and Communications Networks. *Social Network Analysis and Mining*, *15*(78), https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-025-01506-y.

The data used in the analyses in the paper cannot be made publicly available at this point in time. Synthetic networks have been provided in the Data folder, with example results in the Test Results folder. Note that the current implementations in the disruption_targeting_analysis_functions.py file have only been validated for use with undirected, unweighted, one-mode networks; use with other types of graphs or networks requires additional testing.
